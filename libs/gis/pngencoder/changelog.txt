  Changes from v1.2 -> 1.3.1: (6 April 2000)
     * Now using DeflaterOutputStream instead of Deflater

  Changes from v1.0 -> 1.1:
  
     * fixed bug in calculation of how many rows to process
       during scanline compression
     * took out code for multiple IDAT chunks, as I am either
       doing it incorrectly, or PhotoShop & Netscape can't
       handle it properly.
     * added alpha encoding
