To work on scheduler do the following:


Add an entry in TaskBean.


1. create a service with the ff. important attributes:

   add a method named timeout that accepts an Object parameter for TaskInfo.
   The value must return boolean. See signature below:

   boolean timeout( Object taskinfo );

   If you do not want to use the timeout method, the scriptname must be written
   as follows:  serviceName.fire.  

   Note: Interceptors should work in this case.

2. provide an entry in TaskBean in the database. Scriptname should corrspond 
   to the script
